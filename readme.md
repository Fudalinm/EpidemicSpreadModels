# Epidemic Spread Models

#### This project is made for AGH.

##### What this project do?
    The main aim of this project is to research several types of epidemic spread models.
    Using this models we try to predict future core numberes related to epidemic.

##### Basic usage

##### Data information
    In this project there are several sources of data:
    Tests made:
        -
    
    Poulation data:
        -
    
    Infectious, recovered, dead data:
        -
    
    Relocating reports
        - 

##### Models used
    On this very basic start we use SIR model to predict/model epidemic. 
    In future we will create more engines and some more sophisticated models.

##### Bibliography|Reference|Code used
    We based our prediction model on the following work
